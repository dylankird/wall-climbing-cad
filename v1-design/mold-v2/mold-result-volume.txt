How to calculate volume of tire:
-Open the python console - view -> Panels -> Python Console
-Run: target_object=App.ActiveDocument.getObjectsByLabel("mold-result")[0]
-Note: "mold-result" is the label of the body that contains the solid to be measured
-Run: target_object.Shape.Volume
-The volume will be output in mm^3
-The result in this case is 32821.31800948133 (You can convert it to 2.18 Tablespoons)
-Other commands:
target_object.Shape.Area
target_object.Shape.CenterOfMass
